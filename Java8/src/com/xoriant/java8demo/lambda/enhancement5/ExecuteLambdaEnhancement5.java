/**
 * The return type of a lambda expression is an interface with a method having
 * double as an argument. In this case it is Notification
 * 
 * What if we can have two more interface OtherNotification1, OtherNotification1
 * with a method having double as an argument?
 * 
 * Yes, in that case lambda expression can be assigned to any one of them.
 * 
 * What if there is more than one method writeLog() in the Notification
 * Interface?? Then lambda expression will give compilation error as it will not
 * be able to resolve which method to infer.
 * 
 * Is there a way to restrict the developer not to make this mistake? This can
 * be done by adding @FunctionalInterface annotation in Notification interface
 * 
 * Lambda Expression Syntax has 1. Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty
 * as well. 2. Arrow-token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of
 * expression. 3. Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda
 * expression. 4. Return type
 * 
 * In a Lambda expression the below parameters are automatic inference no need
 * of explicit declaration. 1. The data type of arguments 2. use of return
 * keyword, in case there is only return statement present in the Lambda body 3.
 * No need of parentheses if only one statement is present in Lambda body
 * 
 * What if the same double balance as argument for lambda at the same time it is
 * the only data to be printed then method reference can be used. like (p)->
 * System.out.println(p) then we can also write System.out::println which is
 * also called as Method Reference
