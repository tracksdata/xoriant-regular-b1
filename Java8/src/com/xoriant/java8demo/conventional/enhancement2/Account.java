/**
 * Problem statement: An account user wants to do withdraw or deposit
 * 
 * Bank wants to send email notification each time an account holder does
 * withdraw or deposit
 * 
 * Is it logically correct to keep the notification functionality along with the
 * Transactions?? No, A class should have only one reason to change only when
 * deposit or withdraw logic changes but not when any new notification is added
 * as it is a violation of SRP (Single Responsibility design principle)
