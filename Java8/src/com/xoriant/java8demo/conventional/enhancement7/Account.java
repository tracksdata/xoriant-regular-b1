/**
 * Problem statement: An account user wants to do withdraw or deposit
 * 
 * Bank wants to send email notification each time he does withdraw or deposit
 * 
 * Is it logically correct to keep the notification functionality along with the
 * Transactions?? No, A class should have only one reason to change only when
 * deposit or withdraw logic changes but not when any new notification is added
 * as it is a violation of SRP (Single Responsibility design principle)
 * 
 * Let's create a class called Alert and add this sendMail() in that
 * 
 * What if bank wants to send mail as well as SMS?? Again we need to change the
 * code in Account class. What can be a better solution here??
 * 
 * Yes, let's create a Notification Interface and define an implementations such
 * as AlertEmail and AlertSMS which will decide what kind of notification to be
 * sent without changing any code in Account class
 * 
 * But if you can observe here only one type of notification we can set here
 * either email or SMS. What if we want both type of notification to subscribe?
 * 
 * Yes, it is possible to use List<Notification>
 * 
 * What if now bank needs to send one type of notification as what'sapp message
 * 
 * For this we need to create one more implementation class AlertWhatsApp. But
 * do you think this time it is required to change any code in the Account
 * class. No, not required. This is called decoupling/loose coupling using an
 * interface.
